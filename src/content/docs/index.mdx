Welcome! This handbook is the primary landing page for the 8-week remote AI Engineer interview prep program. Use it as the central hub to understand the flow of the syllabus and jump into any week’s detailed guide.

## How This Plan Works

- **Duration:** Full-time schedule across 8 weeks.
- **Structure:** Each week focuses on one or two themes with goals, connected concepts, curated resources, practice tasks, and reflection prompts.
- **Outcome:** Confidence across DSA, system design (including LLM/big data systems), ML/LLM fundamentals, RAG, agents, data engineering, and behavioral interviews.
- **Interlinking:** Notice how topics reinforce each other—e.g., data structures power distributed designs, and ML basics inform LLM systems.

## Weekly Guides

| Week | Theme | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Week 1 — Coding Fundamentals](./guides/interview-prep/week-1) | Python DSA foundations | Arrays, strings, hash tables, Big-O drills, mini CLI project |
| [Week 2 — Algorithms & Patterns](./guides/interview-prep/week-2) | Advanced structures & problem patterns | Trees/graphs/heaps, sorting/searching, recursion/DP, pattern recognition |
| [Week 3 — System Design & Big Data](./guides/interview-prep/week-3) | Distributed fundamentals & pipelines | Load balancing, queues, batch vs streaming, Spark/Kafka deep-dives |
| [Week 4 — ML & LLM Fundamentals](./guides/interview-prep/week-4) | Theory & core concepts | Transformers/attention, prompting vs fine-tuning, RLHF, evaluation |
| [Week 5 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation](./guides/interview-prep/week-5) | RAG architecture | Ingestion → embeddings → vector DB → retrieval → generation, evaluation techniques |
| [Week 6 — AI Agents & Orchestration](./guides/interview-prep/week-6) | Tool-using and multi-agent systems | ReAct, Planner–Executor, guardrails, HITL, AgentOps monitoring |
| [Week 7 — Behavioral & Remote Skills](./guides/interview-prep/week-7) | STAR storytelling & remote collaboration | Conflict resolution, leadership, async communication, remote best practices |
| [Week 8 — Synthesis & Mock Interviews](./guides/interview-prep/week-8) | Integration & final prep | Full mocks (coding, design, ML/LLM, behavioral), mind map, final checklist |

## Getting Started

1. Read the **[Overview](./guides/interview-prep/overview)** for mindset, daily cadence, and reflection habits.
2. Block calendar time for each week’s practice (coding blocks, design sessions, mock interviews).
3. Track progress in a simple doc or project board; log reflections and gaps weekly.
4. Join the community (Discord/Slack, if available) to discuss wins, blockers, and share resources.

## Tips for Success

- **Consistency over cramming:** Treat each week as a sprint; keep daily study/reporting cadence.
- **Explain concepts aloud:** Teaching a solution or concept reinforces retention and improves interview communication.
- **Link back to experience:** Tie technical work to projects you’ve shipped; build stories for Week 7.
- **Reflect weekly:** Note wins, struggles, and topics to revisit. Use these notes in Week 8 mocks.
- **Stay healthy:** Remote prep requires energy—schedule breaks, exercise, and rest.

Let’s get started! Pick the current week below and dive in. Stay accountable, iterate on feedback, and support others in the community as they prepare alongside you.
