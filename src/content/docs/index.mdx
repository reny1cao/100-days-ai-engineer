## Welcome

Welcome! This handbook is the central hub for the 8-week remote AI Engineer interview prep program. Use it to understand the flow of the syllabus, jump into any week’s deep-dive, and keep track of community checkpoints.

:::tip[Community-driven]
Share progress and insights with others following the plan. Teaching and discussing solutions reinforces retention and surfaces blind spots early.
:::

## How This Plan Works

- **Duration:** Full-time schedule across 8 weeks.
- **Structure:** Each week focuses on one or two themes with goals, connected concepts, curated resources, practice tasks, and reflection prompts.
- **Outcome:** Confidence across DSA, system design (including LLM/big data systems), ML/LLM fundamentals, RAG, agents, data engineering, and behavioral interviews.
- **Interlinking:** Notice how topics reinforce each other—e.g., data structures power distributed designs, and ML basics inform LLM systems.

:::note[Daily cadence]
Set a daily routine that blends focused study blocks (e.g., 2h coding, 1h systems) with reflection time. Consistency beats cramming.

## Milestones & Checkpoints

| Week | Milestone | Suggested Check-in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Finish core Python DSA drills & mini CLI project | Share takeaways and tricky edge cases |
| 2 | Solve 3–4 medium problems across patterns | Record a problem explanation video or voice note |
| 3 | Whiteboard a system design + big data pipeline | Review with a peer or mentor for gaps |
| 4 | Confidently explain Transformers, prompting, RLHF | Create flashcards & quiz yourself |
| 5 | Draft a RAG architecture and evaluation plan | Discuss trade-offs (vector DB, chunking) in community |
| 6 | Prototype a tool-using agent or outline one | Document guardrails and failure handling plan |
| 7 | Finalize 5 STAR stories + remote workflows | Run a mock behavioral interview |
| 8 | Complete full mock loop (coding, design, ML, behavioral) | Debrief, adjust checklist, rest |

## Support & Accountability

- Join or create a weekly sync (30 minutes) to share wins, blockers, and resources discovered.
- Keep a living doc for reflections, questions, and solutions—reference it during Week 8 mocks.
- Pair-program or co-design at least once per week to simulate collaborative interview settings.

:::caution[Protect focus time]
Block calendar slots and treat them as non-negotiable. Multitasking slows progress and hurts retention.
:::

## Getting Started

1. Read the **[Overview](./guides/interview-prep/overview)** for mindset, daily cadence, and reflection habits.
2. Block calendar time for each week’s practice (coding blocks, design sessions, mock interviews).
3. Track progress in a simple doc or project board; log reflections and gaps weekly.
4. Join the community (Discord/Slack, if available) to discuss wins, blockers, and share resources.

## Tips for Success

- **Consistency over cramming:** Treat each week as a sprint; keep daily study/reporting cadence.
- **Explain concepts aloud:** Teaching a solution or concept reinforces retention and improves interview communication.
- **Link back to experience:** Tie technical work to projects you’ve shipped; build stories for Week 7.
- **Reflect weekly:** Note wins, struggles, and topics to revisit. Use these notes in Week 8 mocks.
- **Stay healthy:** Remote prep requires energy—schedule breaks, exercise, and rest.

Let’s get started! Pick the current week below and dive in. Stay accountable, iterate on feedback, and support others in the community as they prepare alongside you.
