## 8-Week AI Engineer Interview Prep

This full-time 8-week study plan builds a strong mental map for remote AI Engineer interviews. Each week focuses on a theme with clear goals, connected concepts, recommended materials, practice tasks, and reflection prompts. By the end, you’ll be confident in coding (DSA), system design (including LLM/big-data systems), ML/LLM concepts (RAG, agents, evaluation), data engineering, and behavioral skills. Throughout, note how topics interlink — e.g., data structures underpin system design, and ML fundamentals inform LLM architecture — to reinforce a holistic understanding.
