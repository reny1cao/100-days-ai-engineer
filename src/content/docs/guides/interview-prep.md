title: AI Engineer Interview Prep (8 Weeks)
description: Remote-friendly, full-time plan connecting coding, systems, ML/LLMs, RAG, agents, data engineering, and behavioral skills.
---

This full-time 8-week syllabus builds a strong mental map for remote AI Engineer interviews. Each week sets goals, resources, practice, and reflection across coding (DSA), system design (incl. big-data and LLM-aware), ML/LLM concepts (RAG, agents, evaluation), data engineering, and behavioral skills.

:::tip[Keep connections in mind]
Notice how topics interlink: data structures support system design; ML fundamentals inform LLM system architecture; RAG and agents blend ML with scalable systems.
:::

## Week 1 — Coding Fundamentals & Data Structures (Python)

Focus: Arrays, strings, linked lists, hash tables, and Big-O to support coding rounds and later design.

- Learning goals: Master core structures and operations; analyze time/space; practice Python patterns.
- Resources: Tech Interview Handbook (DSA + complexity); 5–8 easy LeetCode; Python basics videos/CTCI.
- Practice: 2–3h daily drills; mini CLI contact list (list/dict); explain one solution aloud.
- Reflection: Hand-simulate algorithms; articulate O(1) hash vs O(n) list search; note weak spots.

## Week 2 — Advanced Algorithms & Problem Patterns

Focus: Trees, graphs, heaps, sorting/searching, recursion/backtracking, DP. Recognize common patterns.

- Learning goals: Linked lists, stacks/queues, BFS/DFS, binary search, merge/quick sort, two-pointer, sliding window, DP.
- Resources: TIH deep-dives; Grokking-style pattern guides; medium LeetCode/Grind 75.
- Practice: ~3h/day themed sessions (Tree day, Graph day); implement sort/BFS/DFS and compare.
- Reflection: Identify recurring patterns; write two real-world analogies (graph/social network, tree/hierarchy); flag weak areas.

## Week 3 — System Design & Big Data Architecture

Focus: Distributed fundamentals (scalability, reliability), databases/queues, batch vs streaming, big data components.

- Learning goals: Components, replication, consistency; ETL vs real-time; Spark/Kafka at architecture level.
- Resources: CAP, LB, CDN, caching, sharding (TIH); vendor/Medium big-data pipeline overviews; Grokking/ByteByteGo.
- Practice: Design a web app and a data pipeline; draw ETL with Kafka decoupling + checkpoints; deep-dive on Kafka/Spark/Redis.
- Reflection: 15-min mock design; use a checklist (clients, LB, cache, DB, queues, consistency, monitoring) and tie to your experience.

## Week 4 — ML & LLM Fundamentals (Concepts)

Focus: Transformer intuition (attention), training vs inference, overfitting, prompting vs fine-tuning, RLHF, evaluation.

- Learning goals: Explain how LLMs generate text; key metrics; prompt engineering basics; why RLHF.
- Resources: ML course summaries (Ng); “Illustrated Transformer”; OpenAI/LangChain prompt guides; eval methods (perplexity vs human eval).
- Practice: Flashcards; ELI5 for attention/embeddings/overfitting; small prompting sandbox (with/without context).
- Reflection: Answer “What is RAG and why?” and “What are agent components?” succinctly; connect to your eval/guardrails work.

## Week 5 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Focus: End-to-end RAG pipeline: ingestion → chunking/embeddings → vector DB → retrieval → generation → evaluation.

- Learning goals: Retriever + generator; dense vs sparse; hybrid search; evaluation (retrieval + answer quality); CRAG/feedback loops.
- Resources: DataCamp RAG guides/interview Q&A; LangChain pipeline; vector DBs (FAISS/Pinecone/Weaviate).
- Practice: Design a policy QA chatbot (model, store, retrieval, citations/re-ranking); optional mini-RAG with SentenceTransformers + FAISS.
- Reflection: Draw the RAG workflow from memory; write one-sentence answers for benefits/components/evaluation.

## Week 6 — AI Agents & Orchestration

Focus: Agents that plan and use tools; single vs multi-agent; patterns (ReAct, Planner–Executor); safety (guardrails, HITL), ops.

- Learning goals: Agent = LLM brain + tools + memory + planner/orchestrator; monitoring/AgentOps.
- Resources: ai.plainenglish.io agent Q&A; multi-agent patterns (manager–worker); LangChain/LangGraph docs.
- Practice: Design a “plan-a-trip” agent (Flight/Hotel APIs, itinerary tool); implement a tiny tool-using agent; prepare failure mode mitigation.
- Reflection: Differentiate agents vs single LLM calls; create a design checklist (Goal → Tools → Memory → Single/Multi → Failure → Eval).

## Week 7 — Behavioral & Remote Work Competencies

Focus: STAR stories; remote-first communication, ownership, async collaboration.

- Learning goals: 5–6 stories (conflict, technical challenge, leadership, cross-timezone teamwork, failure/learning, success); remote Q&A.
- Resources: Tech Interview Handbook behavioral guides; remote best practices (async updates, docs, Slack/Jira).
- Practice: Write full STAR stories with metrics; mock interview (1–3 min answers); remote role-play scenarios.
- Reflection: Maintain story index; refine “Tell me about yourself”; ensure authenticity and learning.

## Week 8 — Synthesis, Mocks, and Final Prep

Focus: Integrate weeks 1–7. Run realistic mocks across coding, design, ML/LLM, data eng, behavioral. Final checklists.

- Learning goals: Holistic readiness; smooth remote logistics and clear, structured communication.
- Review: Notes/flashcards; one-page mind map; targeted refresh on weak areas.
- Mocks: Coding (timed, narrated); System design (AI-relevant, requirements→components→scale→reliability→security); ML/LLM Q&A; Behavioral (STAR + closing questions).
- Final: Checklist (cheat sheet, examples, tooling tested). Write a short “What an AI Engineer does” summary. Celebrate progress.
