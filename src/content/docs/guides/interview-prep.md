title: AI Engineer Interview Prep (8 Weeks)
description: Remote-friendly, full-time plan connecting coding, systems, ML/LLMs, RAG, agents, data engineering, and behavioral skills.
---

This full-time 8-week syllabus builds a strong mental map for remote AI Engineer interviews. Each week sets goals, resources, practice, and reflection across coding (DSA), system design (incl. big-data and LLM-aware), ML/LLM concepts (RAG, agents, evaluation), data engineering, and behavioral skills.

:::tip[Keep connections in mind]
Notice how topics interlink: data structures support system design; ML fundamentals inform LLM system architecture; RAG and agents blend ML with scalable systems.

## Overview

- Audience: Candidates preparing for remote AI Engineer roles.
- Format: 8 weeks, full-time; each week has Focus → Learning Goals → Resources → Practice → Reflection.
- Outcome: Confidence across coding, systems (incl. LLM/big data), ML/LLM concepts, data engineering, and behavioral skills.

## Week 1 — Coding Fundamentals & Data Structures (Python)

### Focus
Arrays, strings, linked lists, hash tables, and Big-O to support coding rounds and later design.

### Learning Goals
- Master core structures and operations; analyze time/space; practice Python patterns (loops, recursion).

### Key Connections
DSA skills support Week 2 patterns and Week 3 system design; complexity intuition helps pipeline and LLM latency/throughput choices.

### Study Resources
- Tech Interview Handbook (DSA, complexity): https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/
- Practice platforms: https://leetcode.com/ (Easy), https://www.hackerrank.com/
- Python interview basics or CTCI arrays/strings (Python-specific tips).

### Practice & Activities
- Daily drills (2–3h): Arrays/strings first (two-pointer, hash maps); journal approach + complexity.
- Mini-project: CLI contact list using list/dict; add/search; test edge cases.
- Mock explanation: Explain one solved problem out loud.

### Checkpoint & Reflection
Hand-simulate simple algorithms; explain O(1) hash vs O(n) scan; list trade-offs and weak spots for Week 2.

## Week 2 — Advanced Algorithms & Problem Patterns

### Focus
Trees, graphs, heaps, sorting/searching, recursion/backtracking, DP. Recognize common patterns.

### Learning Goals
- Linked lists, stacks/queues, BFS/DFS; binary search; merge/quick sort; two-pointer, sliding window, DP.

### Key Connections
Builds on Week 1 and preps Week 3. Trees/graphs mirror distributed topologies; search informs Week 5 retrieval.

### Study Resources
- Deep-dives (trees/graphs/heaps/tries, DP): https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/
- Pattern guides (Grokking-style two-pointer, BFS/DFS, DP).
- Practice sets: LeetCode Medium or Grind 75.

### Practice & Activities
- Themed sessions (~3h/day): Tree day, Graph day; 30-min timer per problem.
- Peer discussion: Compare traversal variants and use-cases.
- Implement & compare: Code sort/BFS/DFS; compare with stdlib performance.

### Checkpoint & Reflection
Solve mediums in time; map new problems to patterns; write two analogies (graph/social, tree/hierarchy); flag DP or other gaps.

## Week 3 — System Design & Big Data Architecture

### Focus
Distributed fundamentals (scalability, reliability), databases/queues, batch vs streaming, big data components.

### Learning Goals
- Components, replication, consistency; ETL vs real-time; Spark/Kafka at architecture level.

### Key Connections
Queues/trees map to Kafka topics and indexes; sets foundation for Week 4 ML systems and Week 6 data engineering.

### Study Resources
- System design basics (CAP, LB, CDN, caching, sharding): https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/
- Big-data pipeline overviews (vendor/Medium/IBM/AWS blogs on ETL and streaming).
- Reference designs: URL shortener, streaming logs, analytics (Grokking/ByteByteGo).

### Practice & Activities
- Design exercises: Web app and data pipeline; identify components, flow, bottlenecks, failure handling.
- Big data focus: ETL → raw store → Spark → warehouse; Kafka for decoupling; checkpoints/retries.
- Deep-dive day: Kafka/Spark/Redis — when to use X vs Y.

### Checkpoint & Reflection
15-min mock design; cover clients, LB, cache, DB, queues, consistency, monitoring; connect to your real experience.

## Week 4 — ML & LLM Fundamentals (Concepts)

### Focus
Transformer intuition (attention), training vs inference, overfitting, prompting vs fine-tuning, RLHF, evaluation.

### Learning Goals
- Explain how LLMs generate text; key ML metrics; prompt engineering basics; why RLHF.

### Key Connections
Theory underpins Week 5 (RAG) and Week 6 (agents); informs model serving and system choices.

### Study Resources
- ML fundamentals: Andrew Ng notes/recaps.
- Transformers: “Illustrated Transformer” or beginner videos.
- Prompting & RLHF: OpenAI/LangChain guides.
- Evaluation: Perplexity limits, automated vs human eval.

### Practice & Activities
- Flashcards for key terms (transfer learning, embeddings, RAG vs fine-tuning).
- ELI5: Attention, embeddings, overfitting.
- Mini sandbox: Prompt with/without context and observe differences.

### Checkpoint & Reflection
Answer “What is RAG and why?” and “Agent components?” succinctly; relate to your guardrails/eval experience.

## Week 5 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Focus
End-to-end RAG: ingestion → chunking/embeddings → vector DB → retrieval → generation → evaluation.

### Learning Goals
- Retriever + generator; dense vs sparse; hybrid search; evaluation (retrieval + answer quality); CRAG/feedback loops.

### Key Connections
Applies Week 4 theory in Week 3-style systems; powers tools for Week 6 agents; relies on data engineering.

### Study Resources
- RAG guides/Q&A: https://www.datacamp.com/
- Framework docs: LangChain pipeline (load → split → embed → store → query).
- Vector DBs: FAISS/Pinecone/Weaviate; hybrid/hierarchical retrieval.

### Practice & Activities
- Design: Policy QA chatbot; choose embeddings/vector store; address ambiguity and accuracy (citations/re-ranking).
- Mini RAG (optional): SentenceTransformers + FAISS; retrieve top-k and answer.
- Q&A drills: Why vector DB? Handling long docs? How to evaluate RAG?

### Checkpoint & Reflection
Draw the RAG workflow; write concise answers for benefits/components/evaluation; tie to past projects.

## Week 6 — AI Agents & Orchestration

### Focus
Agents that plan and use tools; single vs multi-agent; patterns (ReAct, Planner–Executor); safety (guardrails, HITL), ops.

### Learning Goals
- Agent = LLM brain + tools + memory + planner/orchestrator; monitoring/AgentOps.

### Key Connections
Agents often use RAG (Week 5) and require orchestration (Week 3); informs behavioral stories (Week 7).

### Study Resources
- Agent Q&A: https://ai.plainenglish.io/

- Safety & ops: Guardrails, prompt versioning, monitoring, HITL.

### Practice & Activities
- Design scenario: “Plan-a-trip” agent with Flight/Hotel APIs and itinerary tool; error handling; evaluation.
- Implement: Tiny tool-using agent (function-calling or LangChain tool) with constraints.
- Agent Q&A: When to use tools, failure modes (loops/off-track), mitigations.

### Checkpoint & Reflection
Differentiate agents vs single LLM calls; create a design checklist (Goal → Tools → Memory → Single/Multi → Failure → Eval).

## Week 7 — Behavioral & Remote Work Competencies

### Focus
STAR stories; remote-first communication, ownership, async collaboration.

### Learning Goals
- 5–6 stories (conflict, challenge, leadership, cross-timezone teamwork, failure/learning, success); remote Q&A.

### Key Connections
Tie Weeks 1–6 technical work to behavioral stories (guardrails, pipeline fixes, delivery under constraints).

### Study Resources
- STAR and behavioral guides: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/
- Remote best practices: Async updates, documentation, Slack/Jira.

### Practice & Activities
- Write full STAR stories with metrics; mock interview (1–3 min answers).
- Remote role-play: Communication challenges; independent execution.

### Checkpoint & Reflection
Maintain a story index; refine “Tell me about yourself”; ensure authenticity and learning focus.

## Week 8 — Synthesis, Mocks, and Final Prep

### Focus
Integrate Weeks 1–7. Run realistic mocks across coding, design, ML/LLM, data eng, behavioral. Final checklists.

### Learning Goals
- Holistic readiness; smooth remote logistics; clear, structured communication.

### Review
- Notes/flashcards; one-page mind map; targeted refresh on weak areas.

### Mocks
- Coding: Timed, narrated problems; analyze optimality and clarity.

### Final Checklist & Reflection
- Checklist: Cheat sheet reviewed, examples ready, tools tested (editor/Zoom), notes handy.
- Write a short “What an AI Engineer does” summary; acknowledge progress; build confidence.
