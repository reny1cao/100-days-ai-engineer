title: Week 8 — Synthesis, Mocks, and Final Prep
description: Integrate skills; run coding/system design/ML/behavioral mocks; finalize checklists.
---

Focus

Tie everything together. Run realistic mocks across coding, system design, ML/LLM, data engineering, and behavioral. Polish logistics for remote interviews.

:::tip[Simulate interview days]
Schedule back-to-back mock rounds (coding → design → behavioral) to build stamina and adjust pacing before real interviews.
:::

Learning Goals

- Holistic integration of skills; identify and close remaining gaps.
- Be comfortable with remote interview tools and structured, concise communication.

Key Connections

Explicitly combine Weeks 1–7 in mocks: DSA → design → ML/LLM (RAG/agents) → ops/data → behavioral storytelling.

Study/Revision Plan

| Focus | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| Review | Revisit notes, flashcards, tricky topics |
| Synthesize | Create a one-page mind map linking weeks |
| Brush-up | Target weak spots (e.g., DP, Kubernetes basics) |

Mock Interviews

- Coding: Timed problems with live narration; review for optimality.
- System design: AI-centric scenario (e.g., RAG or analytics); cover requirements, components, scale, reliability, security.
- ML/LLM: Rapid-fire Q&A on terminology, comparisons, evaluation strategies.
- Behavioral: Full STAR rounds, including “Tell me about yourself” and closing questions.

Final Checklist & Reflection

- Checklist: Cheat sheet reviewed, examples ready, tools tested (editor/Zoom), notes handy.
- Reflection: One-paragraph “What an AI Engineer does” blending coding, systems, ML/LLM, data, teamwork. Acknowledge progress and build confidence.
