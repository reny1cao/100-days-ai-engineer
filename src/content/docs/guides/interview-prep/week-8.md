title: Week 8 — Synthesis, Mocks, and Final Prep
description: Integrate skills; run coding/system design/ML/behavioral mocks; finalize checklists.

Focus

Tie everything together. Run realistic mocks across coding, system design, ML/LLM, data eng, and behavioral. Polish logistics for remote interviews.

Learning Goals

- Holistic integration of skills; identify and close remaining gaps.
- Be comfortable with remote interview tools and structured, concise communication.

Key Connections

Explicitly combine Weeks 1–7 in mocks: DSA → design → ML/LLM (RAG/agents) → ops/data → behavioral storytelling.

Study/Revision Plan

- Review Notes & Flashcards: Revisit summaries and tricky cards.
- High-Level Mind Map: One-page cheat sheet connecting major topics.
- Targeted Brush-up: Focused refresh on any weak area (e.g., DP or K8s basics).

Mock Interviews

- Coding Mock: Time-boxed problems; narrate approach; analyze optimality and clarity.
- System Design Mock: AI-relevant scenario (e.g., “ChatGPT over custom KB” or real-time analytics). Cover requirements, components, scaling, reliability, security.
- ML/LLM Q&A: Define terms, compare approaches (RAG vs fine-tuning), evaluation.
- Behavioral Mock: STAR answers; “Tell me about yourself”; strong closing questions.

Final Checklist & Reflection

- Checklist: Cheat sheet reviewed, examples ready, tools tested (editor/Zoom), notes handy.
- Reflection: One-paragraph “What an AI Engineer does” blending coding, systems, ML/LLM, data, teamwork. Acknowledge progress and build confidence.
