title: Sprint 2 — Algorithms & Problem Patterns
description: Ten-day sprint dedicated to advanced data structures, pattern recognition, and communication drills.
---

Focus Areas

- Recognize and apply common interview patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, BFS/DFS, DP, etc.).
- Connect algorithm trade-offs to system considerations (throughput, memory, reliability).
- Expand behavioral story library with impact-focused narratives.

Notes

- Treat each pattern as a reusable building block; record key heuristics alongside solved problems.
- Tie each algorithm lesson to a real system scenario to cement intuition.
- Use milestone day to assess both speed and clarity of explanation.
