title: AI Engineer Interview Prep Sprints
description: Remote-friendly, full-time plan organized into ten themed sprints covering coding, systems, ML/LLMs, RAG, agents, data engineering, and interview mastery.
---

Overview

This full-time program now runs across ten sprints. Each sprint focuses on a tightly scoped theme with daily goals, resources, practice, and reflection. You’ll integrate:

- Coding (Python, DSA, patterns)
- System design (incl. big-data and LLM-aware design)
- ML/LLM concepts (Transformers, evaluation, RAG, agents)
- Data engineering (pipelines, storage, streaming)
- Behavioral and remote collaboration skills

:::tip[Connect the dots]
Data structures support system design; ML fundamentals inform LLM architecture; RAG and agents blend ML with scalable systems. Revisit these links every sprint to reinforce retention.

Sprint roadmap

- Sprint 1: Python DSA Foundations
- Sprint 2: Algorithms & Pattern Recognition
- Sprint 3: System Design & Big Data
- Sprint 4: ML & LLM Fundamentals
- Sprint 5: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Sprint 6: Agents & Orchestration
- Sprint 7: Data Engineering for AI
- Sprint 8: LLMOps & Serving
- Sprint 9: Advanced System Design & Whiteboarding
- Sprint 10: Interview Mastery & Negotiation

Suggested cadence per sprint

| Phase | Purpose | Example actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Learn | Build core understanding | 1–2 targeted readings or videos |
| Practice | Apply concepts | Daily drills, mini-projects, system sketches |
| Explain | Solidify by teaching | Record a walkthrough, write a blog note |
| Reflect | Capture lessons | 3–5 bullet takeaways, gaps, and next steps |
