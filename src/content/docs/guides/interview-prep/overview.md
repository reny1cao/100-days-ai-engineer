title: 8-Week AI Engineer Interview Prep
description: Remote-friendly, full-time plan connecting coding, systems, ML/LLMs, RAG, agents, data engineering, and behavioral skills.
---

Overview

This full-time 8-week study plan builds a strong mental map for AI Engineer interviews. Each week targets a specific theme with goals, resources, practice, and reflection. You’ll integrate:

- Coding (Python, DSA, patterns)
- System design (incl. big-data and LLM-aware design)
- ML/LLM concepts (Transformers, evaluation, RAG, agents)
- Data engineering (pipelines, storage, streaming)
- Behavioral and remote collaboration skills

:::tip[Connect the dots]
Data structures support system design; ML fundamentals inform LLM architecture; RAG and agents blend ML with scalable systems. Revisit these links each week to reinforce retention.

Suggested pattern per week

| Phase | Purpose | Example actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Learn | Build core understanding | 1–2 targeted readings or videos |
| Practice | Apply concepts | Daily drills, mini-projects, system sketches |
| Explain | Solidify by teaching | Record a walkthrough, write a blog note |
| Reflect | Capture lessons | 3–5 bullet takeaways, gaps, and next steps |
