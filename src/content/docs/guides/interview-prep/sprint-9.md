title: Sprint 9 — Advanced System Design & Whiteboarding
description: Ten-day sprint for end-to-end architecture drills and storytelling.
---

Focus Areas

- Practice full system designs for AI-heavy scenarios (NL→SQL, compliance RAG, analytics, SaaS).
- Integrate governance, observability, and cost considerations into every design.
- Polish whiteboarding delivery and documentation artifacts.

Notes

- Recycle components from prior sprints to show architectural consistency.
- Record mock sessions to refine pacing, clarity, and metric storytelling.
