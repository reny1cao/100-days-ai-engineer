description: Prepare STAR stories, remote collaboration strategies, and communication for AI roles.
---

Focus

Behavioral prep with STAR; emphasize remote-first communication, ownership, and collaboration aligned to AI/big data projects.

Learning Goals

- Prepare 5–6 polished STAR stories (conflict, technical challenge, leadership, cross-timezone teamwork, failure/learning, success).
- Answer remote-focused questions (organization, async communication, distributed teamwork) concisely.

Key Connections

Tie technical stories from Weeks 1–6 to behaviors (guardrails, debugging pipelines, delivery under constraints). Adds credibility in technical interviews.

Study Resources

- STAR technique and common behavioral questions — https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/
- Remote best practices: async updates, documentation, tooling (Slack/Jira), proactive check-ins.

Practice & Activities

- Write Out STAR Stories: Full paragraphs with metrics. Include AI/LLM examples (e.g., guardrails, RAG rollout).
- Mock Behavioral Interview: 1–2 sessions; aim 1–3 minutes per answer.
- Remote Role Play: Communication challenge story; independent execution story; use Situation→Task→Action→Result.

Checkpoint & Reflection

Maintain a list of stories by theme. Record “Tell me about yourself” and refine clarity and enthusiasm. Ensure authenticity and learning focus.
