title: Week 7 — Behavioral & Remote Work Competencies
description: Prepare STAR stories, remote collaboration strategies, and communication for AI roles.
---

Focus

Behavioral prep with STAR; emphasize remote-first communication, ownership, and collaboration aligned to AI/big data projects.

:::tip[Story bank]
Maintain a spreadsheet with Situation, Task, Action, Result, metrics, and learnings for each scenario. Update throughout the week.

Learning Goals

- Prepare 5–6 polished STAR stories (conflict, technical challenge, leadership, cross-timezone teamwork, failure/learning, success).
- Answer remote-focused questions (organization, async communication, distributed teamwork) concisely.

Key Connections

Tie technical stories from Weeks 1–6 to behaviors (guardrails, debugging pipelines, delivery under constraints). Adds credibility in technical interviews.

Study Resources

| Topic | Resource | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STAR method & questions | Tech Interview Handbook — https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/ | Focus on conflict, leadership, failure |
| Remote collaboration | Articles on async updates, Slack/Jira workflows | Highlight ownership, communication cadence |

Practice & Activities

- Write Out STAR Stories: Full paragraphs with metrics. Include AI/LLM examples (e.g., guardrails, RAG rollout).
- Mock Behavioral Interview: 1–2 sessions; aim 1–3 minutes per answer.
- Remote Role Play: Communication challenge story; independent execution story; use Situation→Task→Action→Result.

Checkpoint & Reflection

- Keep a story index grouped by theme (conflict, challenge, leadership, remote success).
- Record “Tell me about yourself” and iterate for clarity, brevity, energy.
- Validate authenticity—each story should emphasize learnings and impact.
