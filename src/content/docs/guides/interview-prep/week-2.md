title: Week 2 — Advanced Algorithms & Problem Patterns
description: Trees, graphs, heaps; sorting/searching; recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming; pattern recognition.
---

Focus

Tackle complex data structures and algorithmic techniques. Recognize recurring problem patterns for tougher interviews.

:::tip[Pattern-first mindset]
Group new problems by pattern (two-pointer, BFS/DFS, DP) before coding to accelerate recognition and solution planning.
:::

Learning Goals

- Proficiency with linked lists, stacks/queues, trees, graphs, recursion/backtracking.
- Understand classic algorithms (binary search, merge/quick sort) and patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, BFS/DFS, DP).

Key Connections

Builds on Week 1 and preps Week 3 system design. Trees/graphs mirror distributed system topology; search informs retrieval systems (Week 5).

Study Resources

| Topic | Resource | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trees/graphs/heaps | TIH deep-dives — https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/ | Emphasize traversal strategies |
| Patterns | Grokking patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, BFS/DFS, DP) | Build a pattern reference sheet |
| Practice sets | LeetCode Medium, Grind 75 | Cover list cycle, BST ops, graph path, coin change |

Practice & Activities

- Coding Sessions (~3h/day): Themed days (Tree day, Graph day). Use a 30-min timer for easy/medium.
- Peer Discussion: Explain traversal variants and use-cases to a peer/forum.
- Implement & Compare: Code sort/BFS/DFS in Python; compare with stdlib performance on samples.

Checkpoint & Reflection

- Solve medium questions within allotted time.
- Note recurring patterns; add to your pattern reference.
- Draft two analogies (e.g., graphs = social networks) to practice clear explanations.
- Flag difficult areas (e.g., DP) for Week 8 revisits.
