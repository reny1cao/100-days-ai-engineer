Focus

Tackle complex data structures and algorithmic techniques. Recognize recurring problem patterns for tougher interviews.

Learning Goals

- Proficiency with linked lists, stacks/queues, trees, graphs, recursion/backtracking.
- Understand classic algorithms (binary search, merge/quick sort) and patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, BFS/DFS, DP).

Key Connections

Builds on Week 1 and preps Week 3 system design. Trees/graphs mirror distributed system topology; search informs retrieval systems (Week 5).

Study Resources

- Topic Deep-Dive: Trees, graphs, heaps, tries, DP basics — https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/
- Pattern Guides: Grokking-style patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, BFS/DFS, DP).
- Practice: Medium-level problems (LeetCode/Grind 75). Cover: list cycle, BST ops, graph path, DP (coin change).

Practice & Activities

- Coding Sessions (~3h/day): Themed days (Tree day, Graph day). Use a 30-min timer for easy/medium.
- Peer Discussion: Explain traversal variants and use-cases to a peer/forum.
- Implement & Compare: Code sort/BFS/DFS in Python; compare with stdlib performance on samples.

Checkpoint & Reflection

Ensure you can solve medium problems in time. Note recurring patterns you identified. Write two 1-paragraph analogies mapping DS to real systems (e.g., graphs for social networks, trees for hierarchy). Flag any weak area (e.g., DP) for Week 8 review.
