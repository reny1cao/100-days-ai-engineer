title: Sprint 7 — Data Engineering for AI
description: Ten-day sprint focusing on data modeling, quality, pipelines, and governance for AI systems.
---

Focus Areas

- Build trustworthy data pipelines (batch + streaming) with governance and cost awareness.
- Prepare feature stores and monitoring assets for ML/LLM workloads.
- Tie data wins to business value through storytelling.

Notes

- Align data SLAs with downstream ML/LLM requirements; mention this alignment in interviews.
- Capture before/after metrics (cost, latency, quality) for strong behavioral stories.
