title: Week 1 — Coding Fundamentals & Data Structures (Python)
description: Build a solid algorithmic foundation in Python with core data structures and Big-O complexity.
---

Focus

Build algorithmic foundations in Python: arrays, strings, linked lists, hash tables, and Big-O. This supports coding interviews and later system design.

Learning Goals

- Master basic data structures and their operations; analyze time/space complexity (Big-O).
- Gain fluency with Python patterns (loops, recursion) and write clean, bug-free code.

Key Connections

Strong DSA skills support Week 2 patterns and Week 3 system design. Complexity intuition informs efficient data pipelines and LLM systems.

Study Resources

- Data Structures & Big-O: Tech Interview Handbook overviews (arrays, strings, hash maps, complexity) — https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/
- Python Coding Practice: 5–8 easy LeetCode/HackerRank problems (two-sum, palindrome, frequency count).
- Videos/Guides: Python interview basics or CTCI arrays/strings (Python flavor).

Practice & Activities

- Daily Drills (2–3h): Arrays/strings first; use two-pointer, hash maps; journal approach + complexity.
- Mini-Project: CLI contact list using list/dict; add/search; test edge cases.
- Mock Explanation: Pick one solved problem and explain your approach out loud.

Checkpoint & Reflection

By week’s end, hand-simulate simple algorithms and explain complexity. Reflect: Why hash table lookup is O(1) vs list search O(n)? List trade-offs (time vs space). Note weak points to target in Week 2.
