title: Week 1 — Coding Fundamentals & Data Structures (Python)
description: Build a solid algorithmic foundation in Python with core data structures and Big-O complexity.
---

Focus

Build algorithmic foundations in Python: arrays, strings, linked lists, hash tables, and Big-O. This supports coding interviews and later system design.

:::tip[Schedule]
Alternate between concept review and problem drills: 60 minutes on theory, 90 minutes on practice, 30 minutes on reflection.

Learning Goals

- Master basic data structures and their operations; analyze time/space complexity (Big-O).
- Gain fluency with Python patterns (loops, recursion) and write clean, bug-free code.

Key Connections

Strong DSA skills support Week 2 patterns and Week 3 system design. Complexity intuition informs efficient data pipelines and LLM systems.

Study Resources

| Topic | Resource | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DSA & Big-O | Tech Interview Handbook — https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/ | Focus on arrays, strings, hash maps |
| Coding drills | LeetCode (Easy), HackerRank | Two-sum, palindrome, frequency count |
| Python tips | Interview basics video or CTCI arrays/strings | Emphasize idiomatic Python patterns |

Practice & Activities

- Daily Drills (2–3h): Arrays/strings first; use two-pointer, hash maps; journal approach + complexity.
- Mini-Project: CLI contact list using list/dict; add/search; test edge cases.
- Mock Explanation: Pick one solved problem and explain your approach out loud.

Checkpoint & Reflection

- Hand-simulate simple algorithms and explain complexity.
- Answer: Why is hash lookup O(1) vs list search O(n)? What trade-offs exist?
- Log weak points (e.g., string edge cases) to address in Week 2.
